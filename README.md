Welcome to the simple leaderboard component of our Programmable Banking Card Capture the Flag Challenge! This is where you can see how you stack up against the competition.

## Dependencies

- You would need to create a [Firebase account](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/frameworks/nextjs)
- You can edit the `const answers` variable in the `TeamCard.jsx` file with your specific answers

## 🌐 Overview
The leaderboard is a crucial part of our game, providing a real-time ranking of all participating teams. It's all about friendly competition and seeing who can solve the puzzles the fastest!

## 🛠️ How it Works
Each time a team captures a flag, their score is updated on the leaderboard. The faster you solve the puzzles, the higher you'll climb!

**TODO**: - [ ] The leaderboard is updated in real-time as teams progress through the game. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install
# then
npm run dev
```

** Update the .env.example file to just .env and update with your own values from Firebase**

```bash

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
