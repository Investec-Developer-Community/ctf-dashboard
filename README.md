##  🚩 Capture The Flag Dashboard

Welcome to the simple leaderboard component of our Programmable Banking Card Capture the Flag Challenge! This is where you can see how you stack up against the competition.

## 🌐 Overview
The leaderboard is a crucial part of our game, providing a real-time ranking of all participating teams. It's all about friendly competition and seeing who can solve the puzzles the fastest!

## 🛠️ How it Works
Each time a team captures a flag, their score is updated on the leaderboard. The faster you solve the puzzles, the higher you'll climb!

**TODO**: - [ ] The leaderboard is updated in real-time as teams progress through the game. 

## 🚀 Getting Started
